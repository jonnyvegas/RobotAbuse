Robot Abuse in Unreal Engine 5.6!
The project needs to be opened with Visual Studio and launched from there due to UE5 having to be launched from an IDE when C++ is added. Be sure to set RobotAbuse as the startup project.
The default scene should be the main scene. Click Play In Editor and click in the viewport. If it is not the default scene, open the default level.
Mouse over the right arm (on your left) to highlight it. Mouse over the torso to highlight the whole robot. End mouse over to end highlighting.
Move around with WASD like a plane. Click the LMB to detach/attach the arm. LMB on the torso and drag to have the robot follow you.
When holding the robot, the camera cannot move.
Move the camera by holding down either mouse button and moving the mouse.
Press ESC to end. Have fun!
